				DOODLE FALL INSTRUCTIONS
				========================


DoodleFall is like a "reverse" DoodleJump.

To play DoodleFall, execute MainGame.java.
To start the game, click on the applet viewer and press space.
Doodle will then start falling.

You must guide Doodle (player) left and right, using the keyboard arrows, 
in order to avoid the green platforms (enemy) and catch the blue bonuses.

The further down you get, the harder it becomes to dodge the platforms.
When you reach 100 points, you speed up.
When you reach 150 points, two platforms start to move.
When you reach 300 points, four platforms start to move.
When you reach 400 points, you speed up again.

If you lose 4 lives, you Game Over.

My high score is 1000 points, try to beat it!
